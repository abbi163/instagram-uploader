Hello everyone,

Firstly I would like to thank each and every one of you. We are a community of 4M now. I started this page because my friends would often send me reels asking for the names of the songs that were playing in the background. Realizing there must be many more people looking for songs, I created this page to help everyone.

Recently, we've been facing an issue where a scammer is falsely reporting all our posts, which has led to Instagram taking them down. This is happening despite us having the necessary permissions from the artists and labels to share their content. I've reached out to both, the artists and the labels, and they were equally surprised and concerned about this situation. We're actively working on resolving this issue, but it has been challenging and time-consuming. To ensure we stay connected even if anything happens to our main page, we've created a backup page. We'll be sharing different songs on both pages every day, so you won't see the same content twice. Please follow our backup page finding__good__songs__2.0 in case our main page gets deleted. Meanwhile if there's anyone who can help us with this, please DM us.

Thank you for your support!

Song name in the clip:¬† Mild High Club - Homage
