Did you know? Passenger spent five years busking, playing street gigs, and traveling while making no money, performing at small venues and pubs across Europe and Australia. Reflecting on his breakthrough, he shared, "I canâ€™t really explain how much of a shock it was."

"Let Her Go" was released in July 2012 as the second single from Passenger's third album, All the Little Lights. The song achieved international success, topping charts worldwide and selling over a million digital copies in the UK and more than 4 million in the US.
